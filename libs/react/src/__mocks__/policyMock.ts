This Agreement governs Customer’s access to and use of Cold Climate’s software-as-a-service offering and related services offered through the Cold Climate website (collectively, “Services”).  The scope of Services available to Customer may vary based on the level of Services selected during the ordering process. Customer can establish its account through self-service by providing the required information on the Cold Climate website.  Subject to any charges or limitations identified in the ordering process, Customer may be able to create additional user accounts under the Customer account. All such individuals will be considered Authorized Users under Customer’s account for which Customer remains responsible. The Services may allow Customers to connect or integrate with third-party products not provided or made available by Cold Climate (“Third-Party Products”). Cold Climate has no liability for any Third-Party Products or Customer’s use thereof. Customer is responsible and liable for all uses of the Services and Documentation resulting from access provided by Customer, directly or indirectly, whether such access or use is permitted by or in violation of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer is responsible for all acts and omissions of Authorized Users and any access credentials associated with Customer’s account.\n\n2. _Customer Data_.  Subject to Customer’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Customer and its Authorized Users may capture or submit information, data, and other content, in any form or medium (“Customer Data”) to or through the Services. Cold Climate’s [Privacy Policy](https://app.coldclimate.com/privacy) describes how Cold Climate uses any information Customer submits during the account set-up process.  As between Cold Climate and Customer, Customer retains ownership of and responsibility for Customer Data. Customer represents and warrants that all information provided to Cold Climate is accurate at the time of submission (or Customer will promptly correct any inaccurate information) and Customer has all necessary rights and consents to provide Customer Data to Cold Climate.  Cold Climate may monitor Customer’s use of the Services and collect and compile data and information related to Customer’s use of the Services to be used by Cold Climate in an aggregated and anonymized manner, including to compile statistical and performance information related to the provision and operation of the Services (“Aggregated Statistics”).

Each party’s obligations of non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the date such Confidential Information is first disclosed to the receiving party and will expire five years thereafter; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law.\n\n8. _Intellectual Property Rights_.
