## Deployment Lifecycle
   coming soon

## Getting Started
- Make sure you've followed the instructions to set up your dev machine on [the Dev Setup Notion page](https://www.notion.so/coldclimate/Setting-Up-Your-Local-Environment-95c1f5398890412ab446d7ff94bcec7a?pvs=4), including Homebrew and Docker install
- install node 20.9.0:
  ```bash
    $ brew install node@20.9.0
  ```
- check yarn version 
    ```bash
    $ yarn -v
    ```
    if you receive an error like: ```zsh: command not found: yarn``` then you will need to install yarn globally
  - install latest yarn
    - install corepack globally
    ```bash
    $ yarn add global corepack
    ```
    - enable corepack
    ```bash
    $ corepack enable
    ```
    - set yarn version
    ```bash
    $ yarn set version latest
    ```
- install nestjs cli globally
  ```bash
  $ yarn add global @nestjs/cli 
  ````
- install prisma globally
  ```bash
  $ yarn add global prisma
  ```

### Environment Variables

Either create a .env file in the root directory of the project and populate the following variables. Or make sure they are stored in your IDE (Webstorm). You can get them from the Heroku staging server or ask Troy.

```dotenv
# General Settings
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=7001
API_SERVER_DESCRIPTION=The staging server is our development server
API_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:7001

# Auth0 Variables
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://api.coldclimate.online/
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=UG9T########HQFI
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=6r7D_6i########LoaIYb_
AUTH0_DOMAIN=cold-climate-staging.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_UI_CLIENT_ID=55HO8########SRWpG

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/colddb"

# Redis Cache
REDISCLOUD_URL=redis://localhost:6379

```

### Install Node Dependencies

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Running NX Commands

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
